Certainly! Here are step-by-step instructions to configure and launch an EC2 Linux instance with VPC subnet, internet gateway, and security group:

1. Sign in to AWS Console:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console at https://aws.amazon.com/console/.
   - Sign in using your credentials.

2. Create a VPC:
   - Navigate to the VPC dashboard.
   - Click on "Create VPC" and follow the wizard.
   - Provide a name and CIDR block for your VPC.
   - Make note of the VPC ID for later reference.

3. Create a Subnet:
   - In the VPC dashboard, go to "Subnets" and click on "Create subnet".
   - Choose your VPC from the dropdown.
   - Specify a name, select the availability zone, and provide a CIDR block.
   - Click "Create subnet".
   - Make note of the Subnet ID.

4. Create an Internet Gateway (IGW):
   - In the VPC dashboard, go to "Internet Gateways".
   - Click on "Create internet gateway" and attach it to your VPC.
   - Make note of the Internet Gateway ID.

5. Update Route Table:
   - Go to the "Route Tables" in the VPC dashboard.
   - Select the route table associated with your VPC.
   - Edit the routes and add a route to the internet gateway.
   - This allows traffic from your VPC to the internet.

6. Create a Security Group:
   - Go to the EC2 dashboard and navigate to "Security Groups".
   - Click on "Create security group".
   - Provide a name and description for your security group.
   - Add inbound rules to allow SSH (port 22) and any other necessary ports.
   - Add outbound rules as needed.
   - Make note of the Security Group ID.

7. Launch an EC2 Instance:
   - In the EC2 dashboard, click on "Launch Instance".
   - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), preferably a Linux AMI.
   - Select the instance type, configure instance details, such as subnet and security group.
   - Add storage, tags, and configure any advanced settings if needed.
   - Review and launch the instance.
   - Create a new key pair or choose an existing one to connect to your instance via SSH.
   - Launch the instance.

8. Access the EC2 Instance:
   - Once the instance is running, note its public IP or DNS.
   - Use SSH to connect to the instance using the key pair.
   - `ssh -i your_key.pem ec2-user@your_instance_public_ip`

9. Verify Connectivity:
   - After connecting to the instance, verify internet connectivity.
   - Run commands like `ping`, `curl`, or `wget` to external resources to ensure connectivity.

10. Additional Configuration (Optional):
    - Configure the instance according to your requirements, install software, set up services, etc.

These steps should guide you through setting up an EC2 instance with the required networking components and security groups in AWS.
