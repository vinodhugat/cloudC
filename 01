Creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and launching an instance within it involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Create a VPC**:
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the VPC service.
   - Click on "Create VPC".
   - Enter a name for your VPC and specify the CIDR block (IPv4 range) for the VPC.
   - Optionally, configure other settings such as DNS resolution and DNS hostname.
   - Click on "Create VPC" to create the VPC.

2. **Create Subnets**:
   - After creating the VPC, go to the "Subnets" section in the VPC dashboard.
   - Click on "Create subnet".
   - Specify a name for the subnet, select the VPC you created in step 1, and enter the CIDR block for the subnet.
   - Choose the availability zone for the subnet.
   - Click on "Create subnet" to create the subnet.

3. **Create Internet Gateway (IGW)**:
   - In the VPC dashboard, go to "Internet Gateways".
   - Click on "Create internet gateway".
   - Enter a name for the IGW and click on "Create internet gateway".
   - Select the newly created IGW and attach it to your VPC.

4. **Create Route Table**:
   - Go to the "Route Tables" section in the VPC dashboard.
   - Click on "Create route table".
   - Enter a name for the route table and select your VPC.
   - Click on "Create route table".
   - Select the route table and add a route to the internet gateway (0.0.0.0/0 -> IGW).

5. **Associate Subnet with Route Table**:
   - Go to the "Subnet Associations" tab in the route table settings.
   - Click on "Edit subnet associations" and select the subnet created in step 2.
   - Save the changes.

6. **Launch an EC2 Instance**:
   - Go to the EC2 service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on "Launch Instance".
   - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), instance type, and other configurations.
   - In the "Network" section, select the VPC and subnet created in previous steps.
   - Configure other settings such as security groups, storage, and tags.
   - Review and launch the instance.

7. **Access the Instance**:
   - Once the instance is launched, you can access it using SSH (for Linux instances) or RDP (for Windows instances) using the public IP or DNS provided.
